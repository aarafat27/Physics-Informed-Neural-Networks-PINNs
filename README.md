'üìå' # What Are Physics-Informed Neural Networks?
A Physics-Informed Neural Network is a neural network that integrates physical laws (in the form of differential equations) into the loss function to guide learning. Unlike traditional neural networks, which focus purely on fitting data, PINNs use physical laws as a ‚Äúguiding force,‚Äù ensuring that the predictions remain consistent with fundamental physics.
# Why Do We Need PINNs?
In traditional approaches to solving physical problems, researchers typically rely on numerical methods to solve differential equations. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. PINNs offer a more efficient alternative by leveraging the power of neural networks to learn solutions that adhere to the underlying physics.
# Advantages of PINNs
‚Ä¢ Reduced Computational Cost: By using PINNs, we can solve PDEs without heavy computational infrastructure.
‚Ä¢ Better Generalization: PINNs generalize well to different initial conditions and parameters.
‚Ä¢ Data Scarcity: PINNs require less data, as they are trained using known physical laws rather than needing extensive datasets.
# How PINNs Differ from Traditional Neural Networks
Traditional neural networks are data-driven, learning patterns from labeled data to make predictions. PINNs, however, are physics-driven, integrating known physical equations into the training process.
